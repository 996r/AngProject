Printer Management Application Documentation

1. Project Overview
This is a single-page application (SPA) designed to manage network Printers and Branches. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on printer records. The application is built to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. Technology Stack
Frontend: The user interface is built with Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic single-page applications. The components are structured to manage user interactions and data presentation.

Backend: The server-side logic is handled by Node.js with Express.js, providing a robust and flexible framework for creating REST API endpoints.

Database: MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database for storing printer and branch data. The backend likely uses a library like Mongoose to interact with the database models.

3. Backend API Reference
The backend exposes a REST API for managing printers, branches, and user authentication. All protected routes require an authMiddleware.

Printer Endpoints (/api/printers)
These endpoints are for managing printer records.

GET /
Description: Retrieves a list of all printer records.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with a list of printers.

GET /:id
Description: Retrieves a single printer record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with the printer object, or 404 Not Found if the ID doesn't exist.

POST /
Description: Creates a new printer record.
Authentication: Required.
Request Body: A JSON object containing all required printer fields.
Responses: 201 Created with the new printer object, or 400 Bad Request if validation fails.

PUT /:id
Description: Updates an existing printer record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Request Body: A JSON object containing the fields to update, such as model, serialNumber, address, ipAddress, macAddress, totalCounter, and branch_code.
Logic: The controller first finds the original printer and checks if the branch_code has been changed. If so, it updates the printer count and serial numbers in both the old and new Branch documents. It then uses findByIdAndUpdate to save the new printer data.

Responses:

200 OK: Returns the updated printer object.
404 Not Found: If the printer or the new branch is not found.
400 Bad Request: If a validation error occurs (e.g., non-unique serial number).
500 Server Error: For any other server-side errors.

DELETE /:id

Description: Deletes a printer record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with a success message, or 404 Not Found.
Branch Endpoints (/api/branches)
These endpoints are for managing branch records.

GET /
Description: Retrieves a list of all branch records.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with a list of branches.

GET /:id

Description: Retrieves a single branch record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with the branch object, or 404 Not Found.

POST /

Description: Creates a new branch record.
Authentication: Required.
Request Body: A JSON object with branch details.
Responses: 201 Created with the new branch object.

PUT /:id

Description: Updates an existing branch record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Request Body: A JSON object with updated branch fields.
Responses: 200 OK with the updated branch object, or 404 Not Found.

DELETE /:id

Description: Deletes a branch record by its ID.
Authentication: Required.
Responses: 200 OK with a success message, or 404 Not Found.
Authentication Endpoints (/api/auth)
These endpoints are for user registration and login.

POST /register

Description: Registers a new user.
Authentication: Not required.
Request Body: A JSON object with email, password, and other user details.
Responses: 201 Created with the new user object, or 400 Bad Request.

POST /login

Description: Authenticates a user and issues a JSON Web Token (JWT).
Authentication: Not required.
Request Body: A JSON object with email and password.
Responses: 200 OK with the JWT, or 401 Unauthorized for invalid credentials.

5. Angular Frontend Component Structure

This document provides a clear, hierarchical view of the recommended folder and file structure for your Angular application based on the "presenter pattern" (pp) you've outlined. This structure promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability.

 Top-Level App Folder (src/app)
The core of the application resides in the src/app directory.

app/core
This directory is for single-instance, injectable services and modules that are used throughout the application.

services/

branch.service.ts: Handles all API calls related to branches.

printer.service.ts: Manages all API calls related to printers.

app/features
This is where the main business logic and feature-specific components are located. Each folder within features represents a distinct part of the application.

auth/

login/: Contains the login component, template, and styles.

register/: Contains the user registration component, template, and styles.

branch/

add-branch/: Component for creating a new branch.

branch-board/: The main view for listing all branches.

branch-item/: A reusable child component for displaying a single branch in a list.

printer/

add-printer/: Component for creating a new printer.

edit-printer/: Component for updating an existing printer.

printer-board/: The main view for displaying all printers. Also you can delete existing one.

printer-item/: A reusable child component for displaying a single printer in a list.

app/models
This directory holds the TypeScript interfaces and classes that define the data structures used across the application.

branch.model.ts: Defines the Branch interface.

printer.model.ts: Defines the Printer interface.

user.model.ts: Defines the User interface.

app/shared
This folder is for components, pipes, and directives that are used in multiple features but do not have a single purpose.

components/

footer/: The footer component of the application.

header/: The header component, often including navigation.
